# End-to-End-Car-Damage-Evaluation-Deep-Learning-Pipeline
An end-to-end deep learning pipeline for vehicle damage detection and severity assessment using computer vision. This project leverages TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, and Bootstrap to classify vehicle damage, identify affected areas, and assess severity. Implemented a multi-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification.
